# Homework #3

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects -- variables that gather multiple properties and functions under and assumed identity or name
	* Properties -- paired variables under an object that can be read, altered, added to an object or deleted from an object
	* Methods -- actions that may be performed on objects; stored functions in an object
	* for in loop -- loops that perform the same function repeatedly within and object
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation -- dot notation is cleaner to read and easier to write, but bracket notation allows properties to be accessed with the use of variables


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* `git status`
	* `git add --all`
	* `git status`
	* `git commit -m "your commit message"`
	* `git push origin master`

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.

4. Make the tests pass!
